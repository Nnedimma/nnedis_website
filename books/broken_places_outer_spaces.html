    from her hospital bed deep into her memories, from her painful first experiences with racism as a child in Chicago
    to her powerful visits to her parents’ hometown in Nigeria. From Frida Kahlo to Mary Shelly, she examines great
    artists and writers who have pushed through their limitations, using hardship to fuel their work. Through these
    compelling stories and her own, Nnedi reveals a universal truth: What we perceive as limitations have the potential
    to become our greatest strengths—far greater than when we were unbroken.  A guidebook for anyone eager to understand
    how their limitations might actually be used as a creative springboard, Broken Places &amp; Outer Spaces is an inspiring
    look at how to open up new windows in your mind.">
