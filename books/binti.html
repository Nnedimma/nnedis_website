					<p class="book_description">Her name is Binti, and she is the first of the Himba people ever to be offered a place at Oomza University, the finest institution of higher learning in the galaxy. But to accept the offer will mean giving up her place in her family to travel between the stars among strangers who do not share her ways or respect her customs.</p>
					<p class="book_description">Knowledge comes at a cost, one that Binti is willing to pay, but her journey will not be easy. The world she seeks to enter has long warred with the Meduse, an alien race that has become the stuff of nightmares. Oomza University has wronged the Meduse, and Binti’s stellar travel will bring her within their deadly reach.</p>
					<p class="book_description">If Binti hopes to survive the legacy of a war not of her making, she will need both the the gifts of her people and the wisdom enshrined within the University, itself - but first she has to make it there, alive.</p>
					<p class="book_description">Binti is Nnedi Okorafor's first story set in space.</p>

					<div class="praise_text">“In Binti: Home, Okorafor sends her heroine back to Earth on a quest to reconcile the new, conflicting parts of herself with her roots...Okorafor's writing is even more beautiful than I remember it being in Binti, evocative and sharply elegant in its economy....What Binti: Home says, ultimately, is that traveling the galaxy is relatively easy compared to understanding ourselves and each other — and that this is crucial, necessary work.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-NPR, Amal El-Mohtar, for HOME</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Binti: Home is a rich, complex story of identity, family, and friendship. It's the rare sequel that exceeds the expectations set by the first--a futuristic story that is nonetheless vivid, emotional, and timeless.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Veronica Roth, author of the Divergent series and Carve the Mark (HOME)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Binti’s adventures thus far blend high-concept science fiction ideas with genuine heart and humanity, but most of all, they showcase one of the richest, most compelling characters in recent sci-fi.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Barnes &amp; Noble SFF (HOME)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“[Binti: Home] opens up Binti's tale in astonishing ways, while provocatively exploring questions of identity and kinship.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Chicago Tribune (HOME)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“It very much feels like Binti’s journey has only just begun…the novella ends on a nail-biting cliff-hanger of intergalactic proportions.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Kirkus Review (HOME)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Binti is a compact gem of adventure, bravery and other worlds. Nnedi Okorafor efficiently and effectively uses the short format to create a visual, suspenseful ride. And the heroine, Binti, invites us along to participate in her secret mission. From the start she is special and destined for greater things, but without knowing the tests that will challenge her resilience. As a result, her heroism and vulnerabilities grab our attention, holding tight until the end.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-USA Today (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Binti is a supreme read about a smart, edgy Afropolitan in space! It's a wondrous combination of extra-terrestrial adventure and age-old African diplomacy. Unforgettable!”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Wanuri Kahiu, award-winning Kenyan film director of Pumzi and From a Whisper</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Full of the author’s trademark inventiveness, Home follows Okorafor’s compelling protagonist through a series of events that strip Binti of her comforts, her safe spaces, and her familiar tools in order to prepare Binti for the next stage of her journey.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-SFRA (Science Fiction Research Association) Review (HOME)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Binti is like Ripley, having to deal with death and drama but in a really clever way that drinks from the pool of who she is. It’s a beautiful, heady, a bit scary, and ultimately fulfilling piece of fiction that made me cry in its last paragraph because of its hopeful, uplifting ending.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Kirkus Reviews (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Nnedi Okorafor pens a gorgeous novella set in the outer reaches of space, starring a brave, brilliant girl named Binti. Part coming-of-age tale, part science fiction adventure, Binti is as a whole relatable, beautiful and hard to put down until you've reached the last page.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Heroes and Heartbreakers, Mala Bhattacharjee (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“There’s a lot going on below the surface of Binti, as there always is in Okorafor’s work. Her language is always simple, deceptively so, since there are multiple intriguing ideas and concepts at play in the narrative. ...Okorafor’s stories are where the ancient cultures of Africa meet the future, where what we have been and what makes us human meets what we can be and what we may be in the future.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Tor.com, Mahvesh Murad (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Told in Okorafor’s distinctive visual style, Binti is a wonderful and memorable coming of age story which, to paraphrase Lord of the Rings, shows that one girl can change the course of the galaxy.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-The Geek Syndicate (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“My first reaction on finishing this novella was just the word “wow” repeated over and over again. This is a stunning work of science fiction.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Galaxy Girls and Lady Knights (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“There is a good bit of “stellar travels” and “alien warfare,” so lovers of science fiction are certainly in for a thrill!”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Brittle Paper (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Not only is it a story about an intensely clever, brave and compassionate young woman who finds herself doing several things for the first time, it’s also a first contact story. The brilliance of it lies in just how many versions of that first contact Okorafor folds into the text.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Alastair Stuart (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Equal parts thriller, adventure, and quest, this work also serves as a timely parable about the power of educating girls. In spite of every possible obstacle, Binti is a girl determined to succeed, whose acute intellect will save her world.”<br/></div>

					<span class="praise_authorship">-School Library Journal (starred review) (BINTI)</span>

					<div class="praise_text">“Within a small space, Okorafor efficiently depicts several distinct cultures and portrays a strong and unusual heroine. A cliff-hanger ending promises more excitement to come.”<br/></div>
					<span class="praise_authorship">-Publishers Weekly, (HOME)</span>
